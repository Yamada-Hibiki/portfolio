                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                    <p>I have got solid knowledge of web development. I have already created some 
                       websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I developed this portfolio website by myself as well. 
                       During the summer of 2021, I worked for an Indian company, Pinkcity Artisans, as a web 
                       developer intern using WordPress for 4 months.

                    <p>I am passionate about back-end development, especially machine learning and 
                       software development using Python. Besides my studies, I personally worked on some Python 
                       projects, such as basic projects to understand object-oriented programming, a password 
                       manager, and machine learning projects using Numpy, Tensorflow, and Pytorch.
                       I participated in a programming competition, Hackathon, held in October 2021.

                       to understand in order to work on back-end development. I am currently taking an 
                       online paid course on Algoexpert.com to understand more about algorithms and data structures. 
                       I use Python to solve algorithm problems.

                    passionate about Python development, especially about machine learning. I got LinkedIn Skill Python 
                    Assessement badge and my result was in the top 5% of 3.7 million people who took it. In 2021, I worked 
                    for an Indian company as web a developer intern for 4 months. I learned how to develop websites using HTML,

                    It has been 6 years since I lived in France and I am already used to French culture. In 2021 I received 
                    my French language certificate: Diplôme de français professional des Affaires niveau C1. I went to an international 
                    high school in France and I also received my English certificate: Cambridge Assessment English B2 level.
                </p>
                <p>I am sporty, disciplined, and motivated. I am able to keep working so that I get better results.</p>
